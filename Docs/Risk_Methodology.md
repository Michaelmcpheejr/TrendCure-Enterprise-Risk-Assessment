# Risk Methodology

## Risk Lens
Scenario-based risk statements were used to define realistic, business-relevant risk events.

## Scoring Model
Risk was evaluated using:

Risk = (Threat × Vulnerability) × Impact

Threat and vulnerability were treated as present/confirmed for each scenario. The risk score was calculated using:

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

## Likelihood Scale (1–3)
- 1 = Low
- 2 = Medium
- 3 = High

## Impact Scale (1–5)
- 1 = Negligible
- 2 = Minor
- 3 = Moderate
- 4 = Major
- 5 = Severe

Impact reflects potential business outcomes including regulatory exposure, operational disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.

## Risk Rating Bands
- Low: 1–5
- Medium: 6–14
- High: 15–25
